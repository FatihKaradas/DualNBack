  **Dual N-Back Game**
  
  This project is a brain exercise game called Dual N-Back. The game aims to improve the user's short-term memory. The player must follow the visual stimuli shown in sequence and correctly predict the position of the visual element shown "N" steps before.

  **How to Play?**

-The player is shown a visual position on a grid in each round.

-The player follows the sequence of visual stimuli and tries to correctly predict the position of the visual element shown "N" steps before.

-If the visual position is the same, the player marks it with correct timing.

-The game is designed to improve the player's recall capacity and strengthen short-term memory.
